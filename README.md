A population-based study of 92,213 women with recurrent urinary tract infections and 26,862 women using prophylactic antibiotic users including urine microbiology and resistance patterns: a cross sectional study in Wales from 2010-2020.

The aim of this research is to improve the use of long-term antibiotics used to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in patients who have recurrent UTIs.
